# Diffology (Backend)

Microsoft Access databases are typically kept in a drive made available over LAN, originating a fair number of issues. Diffology was a Microsoft Access Add-in that put a databaseâ€™s schema and data into a git repository allowing users to easily synchronize all changes over the web.

This repository contains code for the backend. The code for the Microsoft Access Add-in can be found at https://github.com/vmsp/diffology_addin
