  <h2>Diffology<sup>(alpha)</sup></h2>

  <p>
    Diffology lets you synchronize data stored in Microsoft Access databases
    over the web without having to deal with complicated configurations,
    requiring technical or programming expertise, or significant changes to your
    current workflow. Just press <strong>Sync</strong> and you're done.
  </p>

  <h3>Features</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Extremely simple to use! No setup!</li>
    <li>Synchronized over the web — no need for network directory sharing.</li>
    <li>Works with split and un-split databases.</li>
    <li>Self-contained. Works with any firewall configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Usage</h3>

  <p>
    Follow the download link below and install Diffology. Next time you open up
    Access, you will have a new menu at the top. When you want to synchronize
    your data just press <strong>Sync</strong> — the first sync will take extra time,
    subsequent syncs will be faster. Your database file is now ready to be
    shared! Just send it over to all collaborators. Diffology will upload your
    changes to the server and download changes introduced by other collaborators.
